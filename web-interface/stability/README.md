# Stability Experiment Web Interface

This folder contains the PHP-based web interfaces used to run **Study 1**. Each script includes embedded PHP, HTML, and JavaScript code to render the experiment interface and handle participant interactions.

The interface runs across multiple sessions and stores participant responses to associated SQL tables.

### Included:
- PHP scripts for rendering trials, consent forms, and instruction pages
- Associated `.png` assets for the user interface
- [`stability_experiment_flow.pdf`](https://github.com/Lior-Lebovich/stabilityFeedbackICB/tree/main/web-interface)/stability_experiment_flow.pdf): A flow diagram summarizing session structure and database storage.
